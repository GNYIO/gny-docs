# Configure

::::: tip

Connect to the right network

:::: tabs

::: tab mainnet

In order to connect to the **`mainnet`** be sure to use one of the following configurations:

> `GNY_P2P_PEERS=/ip4/78.141.235.22/tcp/4097/p2p/QmdEmHir6AxNzHrhWBJ3PfUddRBabmmEGmdSaCenrKMCUh`

:::

::: tab testnet

In order to connect to the **`testnet`** be sure to use one of the following configurations:

> `GNY_P2P_PEERS=/ip4/192.248.155.206/tcp/4097/p2p/QmfJ2QhAfqWySWwQGeLmaxraVvrbJNjUENpoZixKSjuFkS`

## Start Forging

::: warning
Do not reuse your delegate secret on different GNY Blockchain networks (`localnet`, `testnet`, `mainnet`). Otherwise you will make yourself vulnerable to [replay attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack).
:::

::: tip
In order to start forging you need to first register as delegate. Be sure to checkout our [Guides](../guide/) on how to register as `delegate` and how to create a random `secret`.
:::

<ClientOnly>
  <GNYSecret>
  </GNYSecret>
</ClientOnly>

In order to start forging please pass a secret or multiple secrets (comma separated) to the GNY Blockchain. This option is optional.

Change CLI arguments:

```diff
- npm run start
+ npm run start -- --secret="chief next globe deny try danger trust wet spoil away eight task"
```

Change your `docker-compose.yml`:

```diff
services:
  # db1 service omitted
  node1:
    # other keys omitted
    environment:
+     - GNY_SECRET=chief next globe deny try danger trust wet spoil away eight task
```

<br/>

## Configure Public IP

::: warning
The **publicIp** option is mandatory on the `testnet` and on the `mainnet`. If you don't set it then the node will automatically use its privateIp which which will make the p2p communication with other nodes not work.
::::

Pass `public ip` as argument:

```diff
- npm run start
+ npm run start -- --publicIP="20.188.42.0"
```

Pass `public ip` as environment variable:

```diff
services:
  # db1 service omitted
  node1:
    # other keys omitted
    environment:
+	  - GNY_PUBLIC_IP=20.188.42.0
```

::: tip
After that the nodes own `public ip` configuration should be checked with the HTTP API endpoint `/api/peers/info`. This endpoint displays information about the own node!

## Configure Network

The option `network` sets which network the node should connect to. This option is **mandatory**.

The `network` can be passed to the GNY node:

- as argument `--network=mainnet`

::::Â tabs

::: tab mainnet

```diff
services:
  # db1 service omitted

    # other keys omitted
    environment:
+	  - GNY_NETWORK=mainnet
```

:::

::: tab testnet

```diff

    # other keys omitted
    environment:
+	  - GNY_NETWORK=testnet
```

:::: tabs

::: tab mainnet

Pass `p2p peers` as argument:

```diff

+ npm run start -- --peers="/ip4/78.141.235.22/tcp/4097/p2p/QmdEmHir6AxNzHrhWBJ3PfUddRBabmmEGmdSaCenrKMCUh"
```

Pass `p2p peers` as environment variable:

```diff
services:
