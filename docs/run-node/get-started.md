# Get started

In order to participate in the GNY network you will need to run a Blockchain node. It helps to decentralize the network in case other nodes drop out. For producing blocks you need to run a Blockchain node and activate the block generation by supplying your Delegate `secret`.

A Blockchain node consists of a `node.js` app and a `postgres` database.
